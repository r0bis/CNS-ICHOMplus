# Scoring and Visualization 

This document summarises the _scoring_ approaches used for the questionnaires included in our Complex Needs (CNS) service dataset, based on the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) Personality Disorders Standard Set. ICHOM provides internationally agreed definitions and measures to allow meaningful comparison of outcomes across services and countries, and to promote consistent, evidence-based practice. For each instrument, we outline how raw responses are converted into scores, note any subscales, and describe interpretation guidelines. Where questionnaires are not part of the ICHOM standard set but are used locally for their clinical value, scoring follows published conventions for that instrument. _Plans for visualisation_ are included for each measure to support both individual clinical review and aggregate service-level monitoring.



## (DERS-18)

**Name:** Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale 18-item version (DERS-18)

**Timeframe** covered in questions: unspecified/general

### Scoring 

*	Scoring presented as total score
  *	Add together the scores from all items (ranging 1 - 5, where 1 = "almost never", and 5 = "almost always")
  *	Higher scores indicate more difficulties with emotion regulation 

#### Sub-scales

*	Total or mean scores are calculated for each sub-scale (we use mean)
  *	Add the scores of each individual item within the sub-scale together (ranging from 1 - 5) 
  *	Higher scores in the sub-scales indicate more difficulties in that area of emotion regulation

There are 5 sub-scales:

*	Clarity: items 1, 2
*	Goals: items 3, 7, 15 
*	Impulse: items 4, 8, 11
*	Non-acceptance: items 9, 10, 13
*	Strategies: items: items 5, 6, 12, 14, 16

No items are reverse scored, higher scores indicate greater difficulties.

### Plan for visualization

* Time series charts
* One scale - 1 to 5
* Total score is the main item - larger in scale as is sum of all subscales
* all subscales also can be plotted, perhaps with thinner lines occupying lower part of the graph - visual comparison as to whether the subscales are on the same trajectory as the main score. Therapists can wonder if this is related to the clinical picture - for individual graphs.
* aggregate data plot for the whole unit - just main score, perhaps subscales can also be done as a curiosity. 


## PROMIS - Social Isolation

PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) is a set of person-centered measures that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health in adults and children. It can be used with the general population and with individuals living with chronic conditions. PROMIS Short Form v2.0 Social Isolation questions are part of ICHOM dataset that we use.

**Name:** Social Isolation (PROMIS_SF_V2.0) 

**Timeframe** covered in questions: unspecified/general 

### Scoring 
* Scoring presented as total score 
  * Add together all individual items (ranging 1 - 5) 
  * Total score ranges 4 to 20 
  * Higher scores indicate higher perceptions of isolation 

### Plan for visualization

* Time series charts 
* One scale - 1 to 5 for items
* Total score is the measure
* Plot one line, same principle for aggregate data and same for individual

## LPFS-BF

**Name:** The Level of Personality Functioning Scale Brief Form 2.0 (LPFS 2.0)

**Timeframe** covered in questions: at this current moment/today

### Scoring

* Scoring is presented as a total score 
* Add together scores for all individual items (ranging 1 - 4) 
* Total scores range from 12 to 48
*	Higher scores indicate greater difficulties of personality functioning 

#### Sub-scales

1. Self functioning score 
  * Presented as total score 
  * Add together scores for items 1 to 6
  * Total scores range from 6 - 24

2. Interpersonal functioning score 
  * Presented as total score 
  * Add together scores for items 7 to 12
  * Total scores range from 6 - 24


### Plan for visualization

* Time series charts
* Main scale with two subscales 
* Plot total score timeline individual, same for aggregate
  * plot subscales with thinner lines below


## EQ5-D-3L

**Name:** European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Level Version

**Timeframe** covered in questions: at this current moment/today 

### Scoring

This is a 2 part questionnaire 

#### Part 1: Health States - 5 dimensions 

* Each of the dimensions is divided into 3 levels of perceived problems: 
  * Level 1: indicating no problem 
  * Level 2: indicating some problems 
  * Level 3: indicating extreme problems 

Higher score in a dimension indicates problems, but since the level is
descriptive; _maybe_ the highest level descriptor should be displayed as
well. This is an interesting questionnaire from the viewpoint that it is
almost like demographic about physical health - only the last point is
about psychological state.

#### Part 2: Self-rated Health Scale

*  Client records on the scale where they feel their health is currently
at
* VAS scale from 0 to 100
* Higher score indicates better perceived health

### Plan for visualization

* Time series 
* This would be an interesting graph. There are clearly 2 scales
* Plot 5 dimensions of quality of life - maybe with negative sign reversal
for the number - lines with deepest throughs would indicate most perceived
problem. This will also make it easier to plot the self-rated health VAS
above the line. Rationale - higher VAS point - better health perception.
Higher dimension score indicates worse health/qol - so it would make sense
to reverse the sign and plot this below the X axis.

## CORE-10

**Name:** Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE-10)

**Timeframe** covered in questions: over the last week/7days

### Scoring

Scoring presented as a total score (between 0 and 40) and a mean score
(between 0 and 4) 


* There are forward and reverse scored items
* Total Score: Add together scores from all items 
* Mean Score: Divide the total score by number of items (10) 
* Higher scores indicate higher levels of general psychological distress	
* A total score of 11 or above is within the clinically significant range


#### Scoring Categories

10 and less: Non-clinical range
11 - 14: Mild Psychological Distress
15 - 19: Moderate Psychological Distress
20 - 24: Moderate-to-Severe Psychological Distress
25 or above: Severe Psychological Distress 

### Plan for visualization

* Time series
* Total score plotted
* We could have shaded areas indicating scoring categories
* We could indicate with X or other marker the points in time where
the individual has responded to question 6 'I made plans to end my life'
with a response of 3 and above. Or 2 and above. We could mark 2 score with
black X and 3+ score with red X.

## BSL-23

**Name:** Borderline Symptom List (23)

**Timeframe** covered in questions: over the last week/7days

This is borderline symptom list. Taken as + to ICHOM because a) it is
a good/relevant questionnaire and b) it can be used for DBT team
benchmarking across the UK.

Consists of 3 scales. 

BSL itself looks at frequency of symptomatic feelings associated with BPD.
This part has 23 questions, answers are of Likert scale type. The final
part (BSL-23 supplement) looks at behaviour frequency and is best
described as an ordinal scale. The middle item 'Personal State'consists of
one question a visual-analog scale (VAS) where the respondent is asked to
pick between 0 and 100 on a line as to how they have been overall over
last 7 days. Numeric score is recorded for VAS.

### Scoring

*	Scoring presented as mean 
  *	Total all items (ranging 0 - 4, where 0 = not at all, and 4 = very strong)
  *	Total ranges from 0 - 92 
  *	Divide total by 23

6 grades of symptoms severity have been defined. Scores of 1.50 or higher
indicate responses are consistent with BPD.


#### Scoring Categories

0 - 0.3: None/Low
0.3 - 1.1: Mild
1.1 - 1.9: Moderate
1.9 - 2.7: High
2.7 - 3.5: Very High
3.5 - 4: Extremely High


### Borderline Symptom List - Supplement: Items for Assessing Behaviour

**Timeframe** covered in questions: over the last week/7days

Looks at frequency of symptomatic behaviours associated with BPD

#### Scoring

*	Scoring presented as total score
*	Add together all individual items (ranging 0   4, where 0 = not at all, and 4 = daily or more often) 
*	Total score ranges from 0 - 44
*	Higher scores indicate responses are consistent with BPD

#### Borderline Symptom List - Personal State 

**Timeframe** covered in questions: over the last week/7days 

#### Scoring 

Looks at overall personal state. Scoring presented as single percentage
checked by client: Higher percentage score indicates higher perceived
personal state (score closer to 100 means feeling better)

### Plan for visualization

* Time series
* 3 scales that are quite different
* however they all are continuous
* perhaps they are best plotted as 3 separate plots that are stacked on
top of each other, each with its clear title. Fluctuations and trend
should be clear for each and could be compared vertically as they are all
along the same time axis.

## ReQoL-10

**Name:** Recovering Quality of Life (ReQoL-10)

**Timeframe** covered in questions: over the last week/7days 

### Scoring


* presented as total score 
* Add together all individual items (ranging from 0 to 4) 
* NB. There are reversed questions 	
* Total score ranges from 0 to 40 
* Higher scores indicate higher perceived quality of life



#### Scoring Categories 

* 0 - 24: Within the clinical range 
* 25 and above: Within the non-clinical range


#### Changes in ReQol scores

It s important to know if a change in score is clinically reliable and also how such a change in the score compares with those found in the general population or other clinical populations

Reliable change or minimum important difference

Reliable change measures the likelihood that an observed change in scores is due to real change, not to measurement error. The minimum important difference (MID) is the smallest change in a score that is considered clinically or practically important. Both these methods yield the same value, namely 5 points:

-	5 point or more increase = reliable improvement 
-	A change of less than 5 = not reliable
-	5 point or more decrease = reliable deterioration 


### Plan for visualization

* Time series
* Plot the total score over time as line connecting the measurements
* Might be useful to have gridlines with distance of 5 between them
* In case if one measurement submitted so far - plot as dots
  * For aggregate plotting over the casoeload of the whole unit - make sure timeframe is standard - e.g. from start of year, or over the last year, or accross all time - whatever reasonable choice can be made. Show timeframe in the header of the plots page.

## C-SSRS-SR   

**Name:** Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (Self Report)

**Timeframe** covered in questions: the last 30 days


### Scoring

Risk in CSSRS is stratified into Low Moderate High. This is not to be done. Risk score is simply noted and decisions are based on clinical opinion and if available - team consensus. 


### Plan for visualization

* Time series
* Plot the sum with each Y as 1 point
* Indicate all cases where Q6 answered as Y with a red X on the line

## WHODAS-12

**Name:** World Health Organisation Disability Assessment (WHODAS-12. V2.0)

**Timeframe** covered in questions: the last 30 days

There are two parts - first part has 12 questions, looks at activities and is scored. The second part consists of 3 questions and collects numeric data - how many days over the last 30 you had the difficulties, could not do your regular activities etc.

### Scoring

* Scoring presented as total score
  *	Add together all individual items (ranging 1 - 5, whereby 1 = none, and  5 = extreme) 
  *	Total score ranges from 12 - 60
  *	Higher scores indicate higher disability or loss of function 


### Plan for visualization

* Time series
* Plot the total score
* It is possible to put on the individual patient plots the short name for the category where score is 4 or 5 (severe or extreme), that way we could see immediately what categories of their everyday life they see as severely affected. 
  * or we could set shaded area for those parts of timelines which go into
  the severe area.


## MOAS

**Name:** Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS)  
**Timeframe covered in questions:** Past week (aggressive behaviours within last 7 days)  

### Scoring

*Presented as a **total weighted score***  

1. Score each of four aggression domains (verbal, property, self/auto , physical) by summing item scores (0 4 per domain)  
2. Multiply each domain score by a **weight**:  
   * Verbal aggression x 1  
   * Against property x 2  
   * Auto /self aggression x 3  
   * Physical aggression x 4  
3. Add the four **weighted domain sums** to get an overall total score  
4. Higher total indicates **greater frequency and severity** of aggression  

**Typical domain scores:**
- **Verbal Aggression** (e.g., insults, threats): 0-4  
- **Property Aggression** (e.g., smashing objects): 0-4  
- **Auto-Aggression** (self-harm): 0-4  
- **Physical Aggression** (assault on others): 0-4  

**Example:**  
If someone scores 2 verbal, 1 property, 0 auto, 3 physical  
* Weighted: (2x1) + (1x2) + (0x3) + (3x4) = 2 + 2 + 0 + 12 = **16 total score**

### Scoring Categories

ICHOM does **not define standard cut offs or clinical severity bands** within the PD set reference guide.  
Total scores are used for tracking changes in aggression over time, not for categorizing clinical risk thresholds.

### Changes Over Time / Interpretation

* Used as a **monitoring tool** across repeated measurements (e.g. baseline, annual follow up)  
* Useful in **tracking improvements or deteriorations** in aggression severity  
* Interpretation relies on **within-person change**, not fixed clinical bands  
* Clinically meaningful change thresholds are not specified by ICHOM instead users interpret relative changes in context of intervention or clinical status

### Plan for Visualization

* **Time series plot** of total weighted MOAS score  
* Connect successive measurements with lines, or dots if only one point  
* Use **gridlines** in multiples of the smallest meaningful weight (e.g. grid at 5 or 10 points)  
* Label axes: X = measurement timepoint/date, Y = weighted score  
* If aggregating across individuals, define timeframe clearly (e.g.  Aggression scores across PD services in first half of 2025 )  

#### Notes

- MOAS in the ICHOM PD set is designated as an **optional (clinician rated) measure**, recognising challenges of self report for aggression.  
- While earlier research (e.g. in intellectual disability populations) primarily validated simple summed scoring, newer versions such as the **Retrospective MOAS (R MOAS)** suggest that **unweighted frequency scoring** may outperform severity weighted approaches in certain youth settings. ICHOM, however, uses the original weighted MOAS format.
